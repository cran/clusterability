\title{Data generated from a mixture of two multivariate Normal distributions, 2 dimensions.}
\format{A data frame with 150 rows and 3 variables:

\describe{
   \item{x}{x variable}
   \item{y}{y variable}
   \item{cluster}{Distribution from which the observation was sampled}

normals2
}
\description{
A dataset containing 150 observations generated from a mixture of two multivariate
Normal distributions. 75 observations come from a distribution with mean vector
(-3, -2) with each variable having unit variance and uncorrelated with each other.
75 observations come from a distribution with mean vector (1, 1) with each variable
having unit variance and uncorrelated with each other. The dataset is clusterable.

\details{
Remove the cluster variable before using the dataset in any tests.
